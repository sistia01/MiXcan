\title{Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix
Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix (elastic net regression coefficients) from MiXcan() function.
The output can be directly applied to GWAS data for cell-type specific TWAS.}
\usage{
MiXcan_extract_summary(x, y, pi, foldid, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{MiXcan_model}{A direct output from MiXcan() function, which includes the
prediction weights as well as other summaries of the prediction models.}
}
\value{
A data frame with weight for cell 1 and 2, including the potential meta data for the SNP
}
